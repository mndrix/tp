# Convenience for running SWI-Prolog scripts
#
# SWI-Prolog requires some command line switches when executing
# a Prolog file as a script.  Some systems don't pass command line
# arguments that are present in a shebang line.  To work around these
# problems, one can place 'pl' in her PATH and then use
# '#!/usr/bin/env pl' as the shebang line of a script.
/usr/bin/env swipl -q -t main -f $1 -- $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
